            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system (VCS) is the server that acts as the one main repository for all of the files for a project. 
            Version control systems makes it very easy for groups of people to share their information with others for possible revisions.
            A version control system is able to automatically note who changed a file, when that file was changed, what was changed, 
            as well as the capability to merge changes to the same file. A few benefits of a version control system are files cannot be overwritten, 
            there is a common repository that holds all of the latest files, and its biggest benefit of allowing people to work on the same files simultaneously without conflict.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is the repository where files are stored on your own computer. The local repository is where a user can edit their own HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files
            that can then be sent to a remote repository. But in order have a local repository, the individual user needs to create one. There are two ways to create a local repository, 
            the user can create a brand new repository or they can clone an existing remote repository onto their own local machine. Once the new local repository has been created, 
            the user can push files to a remote repository to be access by others. In this class we use Cloud9 as our local repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Remote Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Unlike a local repository, a remote repository resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple team members.
            By using a remote repository, a team or group of people are able to upload and share their documents with their team members and the repository 
            allows revisions to documents and saves all edited versions of the file. In order for a user to grab something from a remote repository, 
            they must pull the files into their local repository. A remote repository is also very beneficial because it allows multiple people to 
            simultaneously work on the same files with no conflicts. In this class we use GitHub as our remote repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a free and open source distributed version control system that we will we using throughout this course. GIT is very user friendly and has a tiny footprint
            with very fast performance. GIT is a very useful version control system with many advantages. When using GIT, every user has their own complete copy of the repository data stored 
            locally on their machine. Also, everything is local so can work offline, and processes run much faster. GIT is also very useful for saving multiple version of one file, 
            it will prevent any unintentional overwriting of a file on the shared repository. In this class we use GitHub.

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As a user using GIT, one must know certain GIT commands in order for the version control system to do what the user is prompting.
            There are many GIT commands, which all have their own functions. But there are three main commands we will be using this semester. The first one is the “add” command, 
            which is responsible for moving code from our workspace into the local index. The second command is the commit command. The commit command is what actually places 
            things into our local repository. Once files are in the local repository, we can perform the third command, the push command. With the push GIT command 
            we are able to “push” or send files from our local repository to the remote repository to share with others.</p>
